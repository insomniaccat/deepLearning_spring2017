# Intro to Deep Learning at Rensselaer Poltechnic Institute

This repository contains my code for the programming projects I've completed for the Introduction to Deep Learning class taught by Dr. Qiang Ji at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Spring 2017. There is code for five projects here: 

1) Implementation of gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent for linear regression. 
2) Implementation of a multi-class logistic regressor for classifying digits 1 through 5 in the MNIST dataset. 
3) Implementation of back propagation for a neural network for classification of MNIST dataset (digits 0 to 9). 
4) A convolutional neural network for classifying CIFAR10 image dataset. 
5) An LSTM recurrent neural network for Twitter sentiment analysis on the sentiment140 dataset.  

Data sets for the projects can be found here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1chS7llOaOvLD_k6mXlmlIehnT28Andhj?usp=sharing 
Original links for the datasets are given in the code files. 

Due to limitations in computing power, in an academic setting, our datasets were smaller in size and fewer in samples than their original sources.

## Getting Started

These instructions can get you a copy of the projects up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

For this project, you need to have python 3.5 and the tensorflow python library v1.4 installed. A good link for setting up your machine can be found here for Ubuntu 16.04:

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/27/setting-up-ubuntu-16-04-cuda-gpu-for-deep-learning-with-python/

You would also need the numpy and matplotlib python libraries to run this project. 

## Running the code

By default the data file should be downloaded and kept in the same directory as the python script. Then, you could run it using the following command:

```
python "filename".py
```
